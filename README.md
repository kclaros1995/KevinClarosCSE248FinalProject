# KevinClarosCSE248FinalProject

For the Final project I will like to have a login screen where the user has the option either to login, or to create a new
account. When the user creates an account, it will ask the user to enter their first name, last name, phone #, address, E-mail,
and password. After that the user will be redirected to an activity where he/she will have to options to buy certain things that
are in-stock in a business. when the user adds stuff to the bag and will like to go to chart, they will have a summary of the 
items that they selected along with the total price of all the items. Last their order summary will be sent using an intent 
to my E-mail address where I will have information about everyting they have selected and their selected address where the stuff
will be shipped/delivered by me with an additonal cost of delivery.
